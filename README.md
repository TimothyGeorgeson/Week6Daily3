Geofencing

Assignment Instructions:

Create an app to use Geofencing

1. Add at least 10 geofences to the client. (Be creative with the names, like planets of something)
2. Every time the user enters or leaves a geofence, the user should get a notification.
3. Record the events in a Room database with time of enter and exit.
4. Show the history of user entering/exiting geofences in a recyclerView.

(You can trigger the geofence by emulating the location on the emulator, for physical device you can use ADB)
